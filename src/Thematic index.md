# A thematic index to the Boxer literature

## LaDDER model

First published in 2003's [Issues in Component Computing: A Synthetic Review? (diSessa et al, 2003)](<papers/Issues in Component Computing, A Synthetic Review - ILE (diSessa, Azevedo, Parnafes, 2003).pdf>),
the LaDDER (Layered Distributed Development of Educational Resources) model describes a pyramidal structure
for organising communities of participants with different technical competences. 

> The core goal of the model is to empower levels of participants with less technological expertise, 
especially teachers and students, to solve as many of their own problems as possible.

## Supporting Learners as Users


An exchange between Mark Guzdial and Andy diSessa in the pages of 1999's Journal of Computer Documentation.

[Supporting Learners as Users (Guzdial, 1999)](<../papers/Supporting Learners as Users - JCD (Guzdial, 1999).pdf>) - Mark's original article,
setting out the requirements software supporting learners - 

> But sometimes, the user's goal is not the same as the explicit task that the
software was designed for.

....

> Learners don't have a single goal or task when they are using an application
program, but two or more.

[How Should Students Learn (diSessa, 1999)](<../papers/How Should Students Learn - JCD (diSessa, 1999).pdf>) - Andy's response,
developing the notion of the "committed learner" and how software for learners should support this model, in addition
to other elements of the hierarchy of needs.

## Boxer Theses

Academic theses that have been written with Boxer as the main focus:

[Bochser, An Integrated Scheme Programming System](<../theses/Bochser, An Integrated Scheme Programming System (Eisenberg, MIT MSc, 1985).pdf>) -
Mike Eisenberg, an MIT Master's Thesis of 1985. Mike retrofits many of Boxer's "naive realism" mechanisms onto a traditional
programming language, Scheme, in order to realise as many as possible of the benefits of this materialisation without
sacrificing traditional evaluation semantics. Concludes with some highly interesting discussion on the ergonomics of
driving language semantics from its visual interface or vice versa &mdash; following Alan Kay's 1984 observation that whilst
the user interface had come to be the first part of a system for typical user systems, that programming languages
had resisted this trend.

> The BOCHSER system which is the subject of this report is unfortunately still an instance of
the "interface following the language" phenomenon &mdash; the point of the system is to take an existing
language and supply the most informative and powerful possible interface to it.
